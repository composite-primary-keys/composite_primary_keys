  limited ids.  For example find(:include => :foo, :limit => 1)

== 3.0.1.b2 2010-11-06

* Port to Rails 3.0 and Ruby 1.9.2

* Backwards compatability issues
  + You can no longer define a composite primary key with a single field.  If you
    try, your model will just default to a standard active record model.  Removing
    this corner case simplified the code.
  + Removed CompositePrimaryKeys::CompositeKeys.  This was done so that the #to_s
    method on composite ids, such as [1,2], returns "[1, 2]".  This in turns
    reduces the amount of core Rails code that needs to be overridden.
  + Setting attribute values by string is no longer supported. For example, this
    no longer works:
      my_record[[:main_id, :secondary_id]] = '1,2'
    Instead, do  this:
      my_record[[:main_id, :secondary_id]] = [1,2]
    Once again, this was done to reduce the amount of overridden Rails code
  + At the moment, complex finds with nested arrays do not work.  For example
    find([[1,2], [3,4]))
  + Count methods no longer work.  For example, Tariff.count(:include => :product_tariffs)
    in the TestAssociations#test_count test returns an error.  This is because Rails 3.0
    uses Arel to perform such calculations, and its not obvious (at least to me) how to
    hook into this new mechanism to support tables with composite keys.
  + The TestPolymorphic#test_polymorphic_has_many_through is currently failing, but this
    looks like an ActiveRecord 3.0 bug to me.
